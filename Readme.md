# List of AI models and what they're best at in my experience

## Life

### General quick answers
Getting quick info that doesn't require citations. Examples: quick recipie ideas, cooking help ('sauce doesn't have enough body, how to fix'), diy tips, etc

- Gemini with 'grounding with Google search' enabled (https://aistudio.google.com/)[Google AI Studio]
   Click the 'grounding with Google Search' switch on the menu on the right side of the screen


### Medium research
For questions where more than a few Google searches are required.

- Grok with 'Deep Research' enabled: download the Grok app, sign up


### Deep Research
For really important, complex topics with multiple criteria. For example creating a detailed checklist of all the things to check yourself when viewing a 1930's Andalucian home that needs restoration, what photos to take for a surveyor's intitial thoughts, and what angles to take photos from with a drone.
